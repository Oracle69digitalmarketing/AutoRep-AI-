# AutoRep AI â€” Adaptive Sales Closer for Informal Agents

Local-language AI that closes deals even when connectivity drops

## Problem

- 200M+ informal agents rely on WhatsApp/USSD and lose leads due to poor follow-up & spotty internet.
- Existing CRMs are expensive, non-localized, and offline-unfriendly.

## Solution

- Offline-first PWA + WhatsApp webhook + Vertex AI for smart replies
- Pinecone scoring + airtime incentives + commission tracking

## Ask

- Mentorship + $5k to build offline sync, local LLMs, and pilot with telco partners
